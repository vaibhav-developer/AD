MongoDB Aggregation
You have been given a dataset containing details about different books. Each book has the
following fields:
● title: The title of the book
● author: The author of the book
● genre: The genre of the book (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi)
● price: The price of the book
● published_date: The date the book was published.
The data has been stored in a MongoDB collection named books.
Using the MongoDB aggregation framework, perform the following tasks:
1. Find the average price of all books.
2. Find the count of books in each genre.
3. For each genre, find the most expensive book.
4. Find the authors who have written maximum books.
5. Sort the books by published_date in descending order.
6. Sort the price in ascending order.
7. create an index on title of the book and describe the index details
