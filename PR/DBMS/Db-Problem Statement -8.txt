Problem Statement: -8
Develop a student database to efficiently manage and retrieve student records (Student id,
Student Name, Class, address, grades, and enrolment details, subject name, attendance.
● Create Views to provide summarized insights into student performance and
attendance. (Consider the attributes which shows attendance of students while
creating view)
● Create Sequences to generate unique student IDs.
● Create an index on a table using student name.


-- Creating the database
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
USE student_db;

-- Creating the student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Student_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Class VARCHAR(50),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    Grades VARCHAR(10),
    Enrolment_details DATE
);

-- Creating the attendance table
CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    Student_id INT,
    Subject_name VARCHAR(255),
    Attendance INT
);

-- Creating a view for student performance and attendance
CREATE VIEW StudentPerformance AS
SELECT Student.Student_id, Student.Student_Name, Student.Class, Attendance.Subject_name, Student.Grades, Attendance.Attendance
FROM Student
JOIN Attendance ON Student.Student_id = Attendance.Student_id;

-- Creating a sequence for generating unique student IDs
CREATE SEQUENCE student_id_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;

-- Creating an index on the student name
CREATE INDEX idx_student_name ON Student (Student_Name);
